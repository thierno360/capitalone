## Capital One MindSumo Project

By Thierno Diallo - University of Virginia '20

### Instructions:

- Link to website: https://thierno-capone-mindsumo.herokuapp.com/

- The major functionality of this website can be found in the toolbar to the right.

- At any moment the user may select "Home" at the top of the page to return to the home page.

- Clicking the "About" button on the top of the page will show you my sources.



### Side Notes:

- "MindSumo_Main" is the main code for the website and allows the user to launch it locally on their machine.

- "MindSumo_Beta" is my early work on the project in order to get the functions to retrieve data with the api properly. Running this will allow you many of the similar functions of the website through a Python terminal (no graphical user interface).

- The website has a tendency of running very slow locally meaning it will run even slower when running publicly.

- In order to simplify the login mechanism and to avoid storing the user's session token, retrieving a user's subscriptions requires login each time.

- Within the templates folder are all the html docs which make up the pages within the website.


### Issues Faced:

- "Smart Sorting" requires the Retrieve Episode Data api but a number of the episode and podcast urls are broken.
